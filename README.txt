The algorithm is adaptive, strategic, and opportunistic, blending cooperation with calculated exploitation. It starts by cooperating to build trust but quickly adapts based on the opponent’s behavior. If the opponent defects frequently (cooperation rate <30%), it punishes harshly; if highly cooperative (>70%), it exploits strategically. Pattern recognition detects alternating or repetitive behaviors for exploitation. A forgiveness mechanism (e.g., cooperating every 10 rounds) prevents mutual defection spirals. In Round 3, it dynamically selects opponents, prioritizing those played least, ensuring balanced interactions. The algorithm always defects in known endgame rounds to maximize points. Its character is mean yet calculated—starting friendly but shifting to punishment or exploitation when provoked. Designed to counter various strategies, it avoids predictability while maintaining competitiveness. By balancing short-term gains with long-term adaptability, the algorithm ensures high performance across diverse opponents.
